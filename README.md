# CAPCO's Flutter Assesment Application

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Chavin Panicharoen. You can call me Loong. I am a developer currently interested in mobile application development. This is my CAPCO's Flutter assesment.

## Brief Project Walkthrough
This application consists of 2 screens in total including<br />

1.) Home Screen<br/>
  This screen shows a scrollable list of all users from the provided API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). The application's user can tap on each user's card to navigate to the Detail page or swipe to refresh the list for some API Updates.
  
2.) Detail Screen<br/>
  This screen shows a detail of a specific user, including their username, full name, address information, and business information. There's an action bar that which Application's user can use to perform a pre-defined action from target user information, including
  
   2.1) Visit target user's website<br />
   2.2) Call target user<br />
   2.3) Email to target user<br />
   2.4) See target user's location<br /><br />
  
## Architecture

There is some adaptation for the assessment, such as model structure, package name, and JSON Decoding/Encoding, but the rest is the same.
